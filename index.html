            <p>My name is Craig, I'm hoping to get myself into a job field that is a bit more 
                tech oriented than my current job. I usually like to go longboarding when the 
                weather is nice, or if that seems a bit too quick paced for me at the time I'll
                just go on a walk. I like gaming, and as of writing this, I am making my way through
                Dark Souls 3 after taking a bit of a break from Kingdom Hearts.
            </p>

            <p>My interest in web development began as I was taking a class through SLCC,
                Living in a Digital World, there was an assignment that had us build a 
                working wiki page about a mock event we were to set up. To style the page, 
                I went into the pages source and started changing things to suit the style of the 
                project. Since then it's been a fascination, and now I've decided to take steps towards
                becoming a web developer.
